I'll be messed up if you can't  be right here
I do the same thing that i told you that i never would
Told you i'd change even when i never could
know that i can't find nobody as good as you
I'd need you to stay,
I need you to stayyyy.. ahe.....aeh


When I am away from you, I miss your touch
You are the reason that I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust.. yeah
I know that i might mess it up
