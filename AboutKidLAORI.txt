I do the same thing that i told you that i never would
Told you i'd change even when i never could
know that i can't find nobody as good as you
I'd need you to stay,
I need you to stayyyy.. ahe.....aeh


When I am away from you, I miss your touch
You are the reason that I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust.. yeah
I know that i might mess it up

Ain't no way i'd leave you stranded
you never left me empty handed
I know that... I can't live without you
So baby stayyy.. aeh aeh aeh

Ohhhhh ohhhhh
ohhhh ohhhh
I'd be messed up If you can't be right here......

 I get drunk, wake up still
 realised time that i have wasted here
 I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
 I'll be messed up if you can't be right here....
